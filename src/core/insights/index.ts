// Hi and welcome ðŸ‘‹
//
// The insights code is written using a Command Queue, or Deferred Execution pattern.
// This pattern is useful when you need to queue up actions that should wait until
// some initialization is complete. In this case, we want to queue up all the analytics
// commands until the analytics service is initialized. This way, we can ensure that
// no analytics events are lost during the initialization process. It looks wildly
// different than other parts of Ably UI, but if you squint you realise it looks very
// much like the services it's wrapping.
//
// There are three pieces working together here:
// - The `AnalyticsService` interface, which defines the public methods that the insights
//   service will expose.
// - The `InsightsCommandQueue` class, which is the main entry point for the insights
//   service. It acts as a proxy that will either queue up commands or execute
//   them directly on the real implementation.
// - The `InsightsService` class, which is the real implementation that will be used
//   after initialization. It's responsible for initializing the underlying analytics
//   services (Mixpanel, Posthog & the data layer) and executing the queued commands.

// Create the singleton instance with the command queue pattern
const insights = new InsightsCommandQueue();

// Export the methods with the same interface as before
